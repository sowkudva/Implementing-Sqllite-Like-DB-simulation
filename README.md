# Implementing-Sqllite-Like-DB-simulation
This project is as part of DBMS class where we implemented basic DB functionalities in a simulated database
This project was build in 4 phases.
Language: Python

Phase 1 : Developed a program that allows a database user to manage the metadata of their relational data.
Functionalities: Database creation,Deletion,Table creation, deletion, update, and query.

Phase 2: Enhanced database that allows user to insert, delete, modify, and query their data on basic tables  
SQL: insert tuples, delete tuples, modify tuples, basic select on tuples                        

Phase 3 : Further enhancements that allows a database user to make queries over multiple tables. 
That is, by implementing table joins    
SQL:innerjoin, leftouterjoin

Phase 4: Implemented transaction locking on the database that was built so far, to handle different processes.

To run the program as below

You can run the code as shown below
■ $ python3 Phase1.py

Also program can read the entire test Sql file, which can be run as shown
■ $python3 Phase2.py < test.sql
